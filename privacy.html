        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties without your consent, except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services on our behalf and require access to such information to carry out their work (e.g., hosting, analytics, customer support). These third parties are obligated to protect your information.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with your consent or at your direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to object to processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section below.</p>

        <h2>6. User Data Deletion Instructions</h2>
        <p>If you wish to delete your data associated with Automation that we have collected through Facebook Login, you have two primary methods:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Through Facebook:</strong>
                <p>You can remove our app from your Facebook account, which will revoke our access to your data. To do this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to your Facebook "Settings & Privacy" > "Settings".</li>
                    <li>Navigate to "Apps and Websites".</li>
                    <li>Find "Automation" in the list and click "Remove".</li>
                    <li>Follow the prompts to confirm the removal. This will stop our app from receiving new data from Facebook and may trigger a data deletion request to us.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Direct Request to Us:</strong>
                <p>You can also send a direct request to us to delete your data. Please contact us at bhardwajnaina50@gmail.com with the subject line "Data Deletion Request - Automation". In your email, please include your Facebook User ID (if known) or the email address associated with your Facebook account to help us identify your data. We will process your request in accordance with applicable laws and Facebook's Platform Policies.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon receiving a valid data deletion request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data from our active databases within a reasonable timeframe, unless retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

        <h2>7. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
